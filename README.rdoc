== README

This API was written to serve data to my Pet Seeker front-end app.  Together, they
make up my submission for Project 4 of the Web Development Immersive course I
attended at General Assembly in DC.

Front end, written with AngularJS:
https://github.com/lelandjordon/pet-seeker

Seeded data should be written into the pet_data.rb and shelter_data.rb files,
then use CLI commands rake `rake db:drop`, etc, to seed them locally.

Special gems added included rack-cors and a few others.
